* We used Git/GitHub version control while working on this assignment to make independent and separated
team work possible.

below is the requested explanation on how we separated the tasks and on which ones we worked together

=========================================================================================================

Task 1: Creating the PokéNav Menu
*Nat and Harshani

Initially we had a variable storing an f-string with the menu options, but after discussing and agreeing
that this program will need to run on a while loop and the fact that the menu will need to keep showing
after each section is finalized we agreed to create a menu_scree() function.

This makes the whole code more readable and modular which makes it easier to update and change over time

Concepts used:
-variables
-input
-printing

Task 2: Identify Hashtags
*Nat

I completed this task by creating a function to detect the # in a post.
The reason why i used a function is for code readability and ease of updating and maintaining
each aspect of the of the program in the future.

Concepts used:
-variables      -for loops                  -functions
-input          -lists                      -conditionals
-printing       -string manipulation
